<h2 align="center"> BMW Prices </h2>

## Task Description

The task is to analyze the used car prices of the BMW brand. This is a regression task because we are trying to 
predict the price of the car. To measure the quality of fit of the model, we will use the [R-squared](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient_of_determination) 

The current best model is a linear regression model with a R-squared of 0.77.

## About the data

The dataset consists of 5000 rows and 18 columns.

The data contains 5000 BMW cars that were sold via a auction in 2018. There are 8 features based on the equipment of car that might have a good impact on the value of the car. There are 75 unique car models in the dataset. There are columns for mileage and engine power. The 8 criteriaâ€™s that might impact value of a used car are labeled feature1 to feature8.
