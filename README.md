## About

The dataset consists of 5000 rows and 18 columns.

The data contains 5000 BMW cars that were sold via a auction in 2018. There are 8 features based on the equipment of car that might have a good impact on the value of the car. There are 75 unique car models in the dataset. There are columns for mileage and engine power. The 8 criteria’s that might impact value of a used car are labeled feature1 to feature8.

The dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/danielkyrka/bmw-pricing-challenge

I built a machine learning model to predict the prices of used BMW cars and In conclusion, the model performed reasonably well, with an R² of 0.7. In other words, my model was better than flipping a coin in predicting the prices of used BMW cars.
